# Diamonds Data Exploration



## Dataset

The dataset contains 11397 rows and 81 columns all with information on the loan details of each customer.



## Summary of Findings 

From various explorations, i found that those who were employed in one form or the other were most likely to repay their debt while others, not so much. Also discovered was the fact that a higher prosperscore indicated a higer abilty to repay loans.

I also observed that lower debtbto income ratios were consistent with repaid loans while higher ones with defaults and charged off loans.  Indicating that the debt to income ratio is a strong determinant of whether or not a customer will be able to repay a loan.

The pattern discovered the various income range categories followed the expected intuition that the mean loan amount would rise as the income bracket gets higher and fall for those that are not employed as they are less likely to repay the loan. 

As for the loan amount variable,the pattern followed a steady upward trend along the prosperscore, indicating that the less risk involved, the higer the loan amount range one has access to.


## Key Insights for Presentation 


The main focus will be on the loan status and original loan amount, where i will attempt to describe the factors that affect them and to what extent. What exactly is the main indicator on a customer's ability to repay a loan? I have answered this by looking at the relationship between the debt to income ratio and the loan status, and from the plot, discovered that the lower the debt to income ratio, the more likely a customer will repay their debt. The second question would be What essentially determines the amount of loan a customer has access to? And to understand this, i have looked at the relationship between the original loan amount and income range as well as the relationship between the original loan amount and prosperscore.
